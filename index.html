                This process will provide a comprehensive review of your autobiographical sketch (ABS), CV
                and essays. Experienced medical students will read your ABS and essays, and give you detailed feedback
                in order to improve and elevate your application package. This is the most important step in receiving an
                interview offer.

                Congratulations you have made it this far in the application process. The interview is the only
                obstacle between you and medical school. There are many brilliant applicants that do not make it past this
                stage as they did not receive proper coaching. Begin your interview prep early with experienced medical
                students to get you ready for any interview question or format you might face.

                <p> 
                    Through extensive research and past experiences, MN Admissions Consulting has identified an
                    unmet student need. Many pre-medical students seek admission consulting immediately prior to
                    application or during the current application cycle. However, in our experience students that start seeking
                    help earlier tend to have better outcomes. Therefore, MN Admission Consulting has introduced a new
                    service to provide students the opportunity to begin their medical school admission journey earlier and
                    have better outcomes. This service is geared towards providing students with the mentorship needed to
                    build a strong foundation that will pave an easier path towards their medical school journey. This service
                    is geared towards undergraduate/graduate students that are not applying in this admission cycle but would
                    like to get tips on improving their overall application for future cycles. This is a longitudinal service that
                    will pair you with an experienced medical student that can help you build a CV that will land you the
                    medical school of your choice. Please email us to hear more about this option.
